ExplosiveElytras is a light-weight plugin built using the Spigot API. This plugin causes explosions to occur when a player impacts an object at a high velocity. These explosions only occur if the player has a certain item in their inventory, such as tnt. This plugin is highly configurable, allowing you to customize the conditions which trigger explosions.
